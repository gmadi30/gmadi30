Hi everyone my name is Georges Madi I am a first year App Developer student in Spain. I am 26 years old from Venezuela
and I have a lot eager to learn and improve on this awesome world of programming.

In my first year I learned Java and Python as my introduction to coding, but, I need to improve my thinking and approach to solving
problems and how to crack code no matter the language. I realize that this is where my biggest weakness is 
and I would like to do this during this summer of 2021 to prepare for my last year of school. 

I am looking forward to collaborating with you at any level, I am here like I said is to learn and if I can at the same time
help with some projects. Just for the record I also learned some MySQL and HTML/CSS/JS, but no frameworks. A bit of bootstrap, but not much.

If you would like to reach me, contact me here on git or the following options:
- Email: georgesmadi30@hotmail.com

Thanks for reading this and I hope to hear from this awesome community very soon.

Georges.
